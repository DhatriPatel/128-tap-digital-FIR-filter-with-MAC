# 128-tap-digital-FIR-filter-with-MAC
This project is based on FPGA/DSP.
The aim is to design 128 tap digital FIR filter.   
To accomplish this goal, Multiplier and Accumulator (MAC) circuit is also designed.   
Additional feature - rounding and saturation of output data. It makes faster and efficient filtering of input data. Output can be generated without any error as FIR filter consists 128 taps in it.   

Tools: Quartus Prime, ModelSim, Synopsys VCS.   
Programming Language: Verilog, C.
